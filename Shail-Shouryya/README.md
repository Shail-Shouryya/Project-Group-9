## The Ask:

Before you start writing any code, remember that you only have one week to complete this project. View this project as a typical assignment from work. Imagine a bunch of data came in and you and your team are tasked with migrating it to a production database
Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:
<ul>
<li> The sources of data that you will extract from. </li>
<li> The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).</li>
<li> The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational). </li>
<li> The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database. </li>
</ul>
<br>
You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.

Optional Assignment:

Visualize the newly transformed data for others to view
